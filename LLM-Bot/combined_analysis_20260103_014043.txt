AUTOMATED IMAGE ANALYSIS (OpenCV):
DERMATOLOGICAL LESION ANALYSIS:

MORPHOLOGY:
- Size: Approximately 38.0mm diameter, 166.1mm² area
- Shape: markedly asymmetric with irregular borders
- Border definition: well-defined
- Overall circularity: 0.121 (1.0 = perfect circle)

COLOR ANALYSIS:
- Number of distinct color zones: 4
- Color composition: light brown/tan 32.2% (mixed distribution); medium brown 29.3% (predominantly central); medium brown 25.1% (predominantly central); medium brown 13.4% (predominantly central)
- Color pattern: Variegated (multiple distinct colors)

SURFACE & TEXTURE:
- Pigmentation pattern: homogeneous pigmentation
- Surface appearance: smooth/uniform
- Texture complexity score: 159.5

BORDER CHARACTERISTICS:
- Border regularity: irregular
- Border definition: well-defined
- Irregularity score: 5.33

ASYMMETRY ASSESSMENT:
- Asymmetry score: 56.4
- Classification: markedly asymmetric

ABCDE MELANOMA RISK FACTORS:
⚠️  A: Significant asymmetry detected
⚠️  B: Irregular border shape
⚠️  C: Multiple colors present (≥4 distinct tones)
⚠️  D: Diameter > 6mm (38.0mm)

SUMMARY FOR CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This lesion presents with 4 distinct color zones, irregular borders,
and markedly asymmetric morphology. Multiple concerning features warrant further evaluation.

NOTE: This is an automated image analysis. Clinical evaluation by a dermatologist
is essential for accurate diagnosis and management decisions.

Histopathologic spectrum of clinically atypical melanocytic nevi. II. Studies of nonfamilial melanoma [published erratum appears in Arch Dermatol 1990 Dec;126(12):1616] We studied the clinically most atypical pigmented lesion removed from each of 142 patients with newly diagnosed sporadic melanoma. The specimens were categorized as to the type of nevus, ie, junctional or compound, presence of congenital features, and degree of nuclear atypicality--presence of nuclear enlargement, nuclear

Recurrent pigmented melanocytic nevus. A benign lesion, not to be mistaken for malignant melanoma. Melanocytic nevi that recur after incomplete removal are pigmented lesions that may clinically and pathologically simulate malignant melanoma in situ. Five examples of recurrent pigmented melanocytic nevus, with emphasis on light microscopic and immunohistochemical findings, are reported herein. Prominent HMB-45 staining in these nevi may cause further confusion in differentiating them from

Compound blue nevus: a variant of blue nevus with an additional junctional dendritic component. A clinical, histopathologic, and immunohistochemical study of six cases. We studied six cases of heavily pigmented melanocytic lesions with features of blue nevi within the dermis, but with an additional junctional dendritic component. This compound variant of blue nevus is an uncommon lesion that has not been previously identified as a distinct histologic entity. Immunoperoxidase staining for S100

Pigmented Bowen's disease arising from pigmented seborrheic keratoses. We report three cases of pigmented Bowen's disease that clinically and histologically had features of seborrheic keratoses. We speculate about the mechanism of pigmentation in these lesions and suggest that they arise from pigmented seborrheic keratoses.

Melanocytic lesions and melanocyte populations in human epidermis. Basal melanocytes were counted and atypia assessed on an arbitrary scale in punch biopsies from the sun-exposed extensor aspect of the forearm of normal skin and from the covered skin of the buttock of patients with pigmented naevi and control subjects. The difference in melanocyte counts and in the presence of atypia between sun-exposed and covered skin was statistically highly significant. The only other difference was between
